== Background

CAMIC3D (Cellular Automata Microstructure in 3D) is a sophisticated simulation model developed to simulate the solidification microstructure of alloys. The model is based on cellular automata models developed in Prof. Charles-Andre Gandin's group. It utilizes raw thermal profile data, including time steps and intervals, node coordinates, temperature at each time step for each node, and metal fraction at each time step for each node. The primary objective is to leverage CPU acceleration to efficiently perform complex calculations and provide accurate simulation results. The project is developed in C++ and will be implemented in Visual Studio, with the source code hosted on GitHub.

== Method

=== Overview
The CAMIC3D model will simulate the alloy solidification microstructure using cellular automata. The core of the simulation will be a novel thermal to CA profile interpolation method, with random grain nucleation and grain growth based on the decentered octahedron algorithm.

=== Thermal to CA Profile Interpolation
A novel method will be implemented to interpolate the thermal profile data into the cellular automata framework. This will involve:
* Reading and parsing the raw thermal profile data.
* Mapping thermal data to the cellular automata grid.
* Interpolating temperature values for each CA cell over time.

=== Grain Nucleation
Grain nucleation will be implemented as a random process, with grains randomly initiating based on user-defined parameters and material properties.

=== Grain Growth
Grain growth will be modeled using the decentered octahedron algorithm. This will involve:
* Calculating growth rates based on thermal and material properties.
* Simulating the expansion of grains over the CA grid.

=== Performance Optimization
The simulation will leverage CPU acceleration techniques to enhance performance. Key strategies include:
* Optimizing data structures for efficient memory access.
* Parallelizing computationally intensive tasks where possible.
* Utilizing efficient algorithms for interpolation and growth calculations.

=== Output Generation
Results will be generated in a format compatible with ParaView for visualization. This will include:
* Writing simulation data to files in ParaView-readable formats.
* Ensuring accurate and detailed output for post-processing and analysis.

=== Console Application
The entire model will be implemented as a console application in C++, providing a command-line interface for inputting data, running simulations, and exporting results.
